We will need to deploy a few services and configure our AWS environment before we can get started.

We will need to complete the following set up steps:

1. Create a Cloud9 environment
2. Create OpenSearch Domains (Leader and Follower)
3. Configure Cross Cluster Replication

To complete the environment set up with a CloudFormation template, follow the steps in the [CloudFormation]({{<relref "../2_Environment_Set_Up/cloudformation_automated">}}).
